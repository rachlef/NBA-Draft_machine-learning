        <h1> Its All About The NBA</h1>
        <hr width="350px">
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"></pstyle> <h5>When did it all start<strong>?</strong></h5> <br>
        
        In order for the NBA to make its slam dunks of today, <u>the <mark>ABL </mark>( American Basketball League founded in 1925)</u>, 
        <u>the <mark>NBL </mark>(National Basketball League founded in 1937) </u>and <u>the<mark>BAA</mark>  (Basketball American Association founded in 1946)</u> 
        <a href = "https://www.prosportsfanatics.com/nba/the-history-of-the-nba " target = "_self">Supported Study</a><br>
        
        all had to first learn how to walk, then dribble, then shoot. The trials and tribulations that these leagues learned from,
         paved the normalcy, rules and regulations that we know of today; such as but not limited to, making backboards mandatory,
          adding a three-second lane violation, implementing foul outs, eliminating the double dribble and signing players to contracts. 
          These are all elements and incentives that facilitated the enhancement of skill sets a player needed, in order to perform and 
          strive for optimal success individually and collectively as a team. 
         <br> 
       <br> The BAA quickly learned that <u>enhanced performers,</u> <u>needs an enhanced stage. </u>
       <br>The prior leagues were used to playing in small areas such as ballrooms and school gyms. 
       But, the BAA was the first league that attempted to play primarily in <u><strong>large</strong></u> arenas in <u><strong>major</strong></u> cities, such as <mark>Madison Square Garden</mark> and <mark>Boston Garden</mark>. 
       <p>And the growth didn’t stop there!<br></p>
       <br>
        So, on August 3, 1949, the BAA agreed to merge with the NBL, creating <mark>National Basketball Association aka the NBA.

            There are few sports where there is an obvious impact between physical attribute and performance; for instance,
             basketball has a bias towards taller people. But even within this, it’s not a 
             direct relationship<mark><strong>; taller the better is <u>not</u> always true.</strong></mark> 
             <br>
             <br>Looking at these data visuals and cross referencing <mark>based on player stats alone is <u>unpredicatable&#8594;</u></mark>  
            due to <mark>limitations in standardizing the assessment of the presence or absence of intangibles components  
            such as coach-ability, character, desire, and instincts.</mark> Teams, drafters, and/or scouters all have to evaluate physical abilities, 
            skill sets, mental attributes, and their potential for growth, which only <u>adds to the challenge.</u>

               <mark>Discussion:</mark> <br>
            The data in this dataset proved to be very difficult to scale and properly fit with the model. We found with each of our models 
            that the accuracy was low and that we experience issues with the data's scalability and fitting the data to the model. Our regression 
            analysis with the validation data shows that the model was not fitting well, with the values not following the trend line closely or at all. 
            We did not have too high of loss for this model however, our regression visualizations show that this model is testing accurately or capable 
            of producing accurate results.  
            </p>
             
            
            The training and validation datasets and predictions vary, the model loss in the predictions made with the training dataset does not vary much 
            however loss does decrease when predictions were made with the validation data. The last regression visualization resulting from our
             neural network model indicates that the data did not fit very well with this model and does not give us a strong indication of leverage or 
             pulling towards a direction more.
            
           <p>
            <mark>Limitations:</mark> <br> Neural networks primarily rely on statistical data for analysis. While statistics play a crucial role in evaluating
             NBA draft prospects, they may not capture certain intangible qualities such as leadership, work ethic, basketball IQ, or teamwork.
              These factors, often observed through subjective evaluations, can significantly impact a player's success but are difficult to quantify
               and incorporate effectively into a neural network model.

             and can exhibit rapid improvement or regression over a short period. Neural networks typically capture patterns based on historical data,
              and their predictions may not fully account for potential skill growth or decline. Keeping up with the latest player developments and 
              incorporating them into the model can be challenging.Neural networks can still provide valuable insights into NBA draft prospects,
               but it is essential to consider these limitations.

                    Conclusion
                </h1>
                The NBA's draft process is an essential part of the league, allowing teams to recruit new talent and build their roster. However, 
                these trends are uncertain and pose difficulties in selecting future stars. A number of factors contribute to the decision-making process,
                 such as physical ability, intelligence, and developmental potential. Machine learning is very useful in developing predictive models using 
                 big data and predictive models. By analyzing player performance and college statistics, teams can make more informed predictions about a player's performance. 
                 Models such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks enhance model development, while feature engineering and prior data are essential for accurate prediction. 
                 While there are limitations, such as the inability to catch certain attributes and the potential benefits of player development, the combination of human intelligence and 
                 machine learning can transform the NBA system and turn the team into a long-term success.
